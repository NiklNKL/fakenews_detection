# fakenews_detection
This is a repository for a university class project about fake news detection using basic data science methods.

You can run it using the "UV" Package Manager.\
Just install uv using `pip install uv`.\

Then run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment with all the required packages.\
Use either `uv run` or `source .venv/bin/activate` to launch the virtual environment.\
Don't forget to select the venv as your interpreter.

You should now see (fakenews-detection) in your terminal in front of every line.\
The interpreter should be **Python 3.10**.
