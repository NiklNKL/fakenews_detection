# Fake News Detection using BERT
This is a repository for a university class project about fake news detection using basic data science methods.\
It explores NLP Processing in 4 Python Notebooks and trains multiple BERT Models as well as some basic binary classification models on the dataset.\
The repo hosts also a Streamlit app, which lets you explore the data as well as play around with different concepts of BERT. 

## Run it locally
You can run it using the "UV" Package Manager.\
Just install uv using `pip install uv`.

Then run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment with all the required packages.\
Use either `uv run` or `source .venv/bin/activate` to launch the virtual environment.\
Don't forget to select the venv as your interpreter.

You should now see (fakenews-detection) in your terminal in front of every line.\
The interpreter should be **Python 3.10**.

## View the Streamlit App
This Project uses a Streamlit application to visual its findings.

The project is hosted on the Streamlit community cloud [here](https://fhdw-fakenews-detection.streamlit.app/).\
You can also run it locally by going to the `streamlit_app` directory and running `streamlit run FakeNewsDetection.py`.

## Note
This Repo will stop active development after the 05/02/2025.
